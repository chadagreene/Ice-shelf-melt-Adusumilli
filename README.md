Just a Matlab function to load and calculate melt rates from Adusumilli et al's 2020 dataset. This function requires Antarctic Mapping Tools, and depending on which data you're plotting, you might also need my BedMachine, ITS_LIVE, and Climate Data Toolbox functions. Sorry about all the interdependency. 

The easiest way to see how to work with this function is to make sure Matlab can find all the contents of these folders and then type 

    showdemo melt_data_adusumilli_documentation

into the Matlab command window. Or just find the melt_data_adusumilli_documentation.html file and open it in a browser.
